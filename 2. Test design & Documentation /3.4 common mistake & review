Common Mistakes in Test Case Design :

🚫 1. Writing vague test steps
❌ "Enter name and submit"

✅ "Enter a valid name in the Name field (e.g., John), then click the Submit button"

🚫 2. No expected result
❌ Test steps without knowing what to expect = pointless.

🚫 3. Too much in one test case
Keep it simple and atomic.

✅ One scenario = one test case

🚫 4. Not using design techniques
Leads to poor coverage and redundant test cases

🚫 5. Not considering negative tests
Always test both valid and invalid inputs

✅ Tip: Use a checklist when reviewing:
Clarity
Expected Result
Positive + Negative
Mapping to requirement
Design technique used?

 How to Review Test Cases :

🎯 Goals of Review:
Improve quality of test cases
Remove duplicates, errors, missing logic
Catch poor assumptions

🔍 Review Checklist:
Aspect	              Check For
Clarity	              Is it easy for anyone to understand?
Coverage	            Are both positive & negative flows covered?
Design Techniques     Used	EP, BVA, State transitions, etc.
Data Preparation	    Are test data needs clearly mentioned?
Expected Result	      Is it specific and verifiable?
Requirement Mapping	  Is there a clear link to a requirement or user story?
Reusability	          Can steps be reused in other test cases or automated scripts?
Duplicates/Conflicts	Is the same scenario covered twice? Are there logical conflicts?
