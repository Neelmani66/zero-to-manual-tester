🧪 TEST CASE DESIGN TECHNIQUES — COMPLETE & PRACTICAL GUIDE
We’ll cover the 6 major Black-Box techniques .

✅ 1. Equivalence Partitioning (EP)
📘 What is it?
Divide input data into valid and invalid partitions — pick 1 value from each partition to reduce redundancy.

💡 Example:
Field: Age input
Valid: 18–60
Invalid: <18 and >60

Partition Type	    Test Value
Valid                	25
Invalid             	17
Invalid             	61

🎯 Use Case:
Useful when you have range inputs, dropdowns, or field validations (age, zip code, salary, etc.)

✅ 2. Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
📘 What is it?
Focus on the edges or boundaries of valid/invalid inputs.

70% of bugs occur at the boundaries.

💡 Example:
Field: Age allowed 18–60

Test                       Type	Value
Below boundary	              17
On lower boundary	            18
Within range	                30
On upper boundary	            60
Above boundary	              61

🎯 Use Case:
When input is numerical or has limits — forms, sliders, date ranges, file size checks.

✅ 3. Decision Table Testing
📘 What is it?
Use a table format to test combinations of conditions and the expected actions.
Good for systems with rules, conditions, and logic.

💡 Example: Login System
Conditions:

C1: Is email filled?
C2: Is password filled?

C1 (Email)	              C2 (Password)            	Action
Yes	                      Yes	                      Allow Login
Yes	                      No	                      Error: Password
No	                      Yes	                      Error: Email
No	                      No	                      Error: Both fields

🎯 Use Case:
Validation forms
Rule-based systems (banking, insurance)
Any “IF → THEN” type logic

✅ 4. State Transition Testing
📘 What is it?
Test based on different states the software goes through — like status changes, user actions, system responses.
Think “What happens after this step?”

💡 Example: ATM
Current State	                     Action	                   New State
Idle	                           Insert Card	             Card Inserted
Card Inserted                    Enter PIN	               PIN Verified
PIN Verified	                   Click Withdraw	           Cash Dispensed
Card Inserted	                   Wrong PIN (3x)	           Card Blocked

🎯 Use Case:
Login flows
Shopping cart
Ticket booking
Multi-step forms

✅ 5. Error Guessing
📘 What is it?
Use your experience and intuition to “guess” areas where bugs might be hidden.
No fixed rules. Based on what often fails.

💡 Example: Login Page
Input special characters in username
Enter spaces only
Use expired credentials
Enter password with 256 characters
Check browser “Back” button after logout

🎯 Use Case:
When testing mature products
During exploratory testing
After learning from past bugs

✅ 6. Use Case Testing
📘 What is it?
Test real user scenarios end-to-end. Often derived from User Stories or Business Requirements.

💡 Example: E-Commerce Checkout
Scenario: Add item → Apply coupon → Pay via UPI → Receive order confirmation

🎯 Use Case:
Story-based flows
Functional E2E validation
Acceptance testing
