🧭 1. Test Plan Definition
A Test Plan is a formal document derived from requirement documents and project plans. 

It outlines:
The testing strategy
Resources, schedules, scope, and objectives
Risks, deliverables, environment setup, and entry/exit criteria

📌 Goal: To communicate clearly what will be tested, why, when, how, and by whom.

📚 2. When Is It Created?
Typically at the start of a testing phase (after requirements are clear)
Even in Agile, a mini test plan or strategy is built for each sprint or release

🔍 3. Complete Test Plan Template :

✅ 1. Test Plan ID
Unique identifier. Example: TP-Ecomm-Web-V1.0

✅ 2. Introduction
Brief about the system under test (SUT)
Describe the application (e.g., E-commerce website, Banking App)
Example:
This Test Plan describes the strategy for testing the "User Authentication & Checkout Module" in the ABC E-commerce Web Application.

✅ 3. Objectives and Tasks
Objectives: Ensure login, registration, cart, and checkout work per business rules

Tasks:
Test environment setup
Write & review test cases
Execute manual test cases
Log & track defects
Re-testing & regression testing
Sprint test report submission


✅ 4. Scope of Testing

In-Scope:
User registration, login/logout
Product search & filtering
Cart operations (add/remove)
Checkout with payment gateway

Out-of-Scope:
Admin panel features
Analytics dashboard
Mobile app version

🧠 Why it's needed: So teams don’t waste time testing modules they’re not responsible for in this cycle.

✅ 5. Test Strategy / Test Approach
How will the testing be done?

Type of Testing:

Functional Testing
UI Testing
Smoke & Regression Testing
Negative Testing

Manual Testing: All test cases will be executed manually.
Test Case Design: Based on BRS, SRS, and User Stories.
Environment: Web staging environment with test data.


✅ 6. Test Deliverables
What documents or artifacts will be delivered:

Test Plan document
Test Scenarios & Cases
Bug Reports
Test Summary Report (TSR)
Daily Execution Reports (if needed)
Screenshots/videos of failures

✅ 7. Testing Schedule
Phase	                         Start Date	                 End Date
Test Planning	                   Jun 1	                    Jun 2
Test Case Writing	               Jun 3	                    Jun 5
