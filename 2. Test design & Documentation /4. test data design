ðŸ§ª What is Test Data Design?
Test Data refers to the data that is used during testing to simulate real-world inputs and check the behavior of a software system.
Test Data Design is the process of planning, creating, and managing data so that test cases can be executed accurately and effectively.

ðŸŽ¯ Why Test Data Design is Crucial
Without valid data, your test cases are meaningless.
Realistic data can help uncover bugs missed by synthetic or random data.
Some tests (e.g., boundary, negative, or load testing) depend entirely on specific data setups.

ðŸ§  Types of Test Data
Type	                   Description	                                              Example
Valid Data	         Data that meets all requirements	                         Correct username/password
Invalid Data	       Incorrect or unexpected input	                           Special characters in name field
Boundary Data	       Data at the edge of allowed ranges	                       Age = 0, Age = 100
Null/Empty           Data	Missing values to test required field validation	   Email = ""
Negative Data	       Data to trigger error handling	                           Withdrawal > Account Balance
Duplicate Data	     To test handling of uniqueness	                           Same phone number twice
Performance Data	   Large-scale input to test load handling                   Upload 10,000 records

ðŸ”§ How Test Data is Prepared :

ðŸ”¹ 1. Manual Data Creation
You manually enter valid/invalid test inputs.
Useful for small-scale or exploratory testing.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Scripted/Automated Generation
Write Python, SQL, or JavaScript scripts to generate bulk data.
Often used for performance or load testing.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Using Production-Like Data (Masked)
Pull anonymized production data (remove sensitive info).
Gives you realistic test conditions.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Data from Databases or APIs
Query databases or hit backend APIs to set up preconditions.

âœ… Tips for Smart Test Data Design
Align data with test objectives (e.g., use invalid data only when testing validation)
Use equivalence partitioning to avoid redundant data.
Include edge cases â€” not just happy paths.
Plan for data reuse â€” store reusable test data in Excel/Sheets.
For automation, generate data dynamically to avoid stale values.

ðŸš§ Challenges in Test Data Design
Problem	                                       Solution
Test data becoming stale	          Generate fresh data during tests
Data dependency between tests	      Use setup scripts or preconditions
Handling sensitive data           	Mask or generate fake equivalents
Database access restrictions	      Use mock data or request access for test env
