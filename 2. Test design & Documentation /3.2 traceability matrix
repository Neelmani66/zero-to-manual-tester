 Traceability Matrix (RTM)
âœ… What is it?
A Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) is a document that links each requirement to its corresponding test cases to ensure:
Everything is tested
No missing or unverified functionality
Easy tracking of coverage

ðŸ“‹ Sample RTM Table:

Requirement ID	     Requirement Description	             Test Case ID(s)	      Status
REQ-01	           User must be able to login	             TC-01, TC-02	           Pass
REQ-02	           Forgot password flow	                   TC-03, TC-04	           Fail
REQ-03	           Cart should update item quantity	       TC-05, TC-06	           Pass

ðŸŽ¯ Why It Matters:
Ensures 100% coverage
Helps identify untested requirements
Useful in audits and reviews
Acts as a proof of quality to stakeholders

ðŸ’¼ Real-Life Usage:
Often created in Excel or tools like Jira, TestRail, Zephyr
During UAT (User Acceptance Testing), RTM is shown to clients
