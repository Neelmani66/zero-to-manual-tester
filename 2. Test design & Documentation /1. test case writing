🧩 What Is a Test Case?
A test case is a set of conditions or steps used to verify a specific function or feature of the software works as expected.

Each test case has:
1. What to test
2. How to test it
3. What the expected result is

🎯 Why Are Test Cases Important?
Standardizes testing – ensures repeatable, consistent testing
Traceability – links back to requirements (via traceability matrix)
Better collaboration – devs, testers, and BAs can understand the scenario
Essential for regression – can be reused again and again
