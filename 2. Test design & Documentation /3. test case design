âœ… 1. What Is Test Case Design?
Definition:
It is the process of designing detailed step-by-step instructions to validate whether a specific feature or function of the software works as intended â€” based on requirements or user stories.

Why It Matters:

Improves coverage
Reduces duplicate work
Makes defects easier to trace
Helps new testers understand the app quickly

âœ… 2. Qualities of a Good Test Case
Every test case should be:

Quality	                                              Explanation
âœ… Clear & Concise	                          No vague steps or outcomes
âœ… Reproducible	                              Anyone can follow and get same result
âœ… Traceable	                                Linked to a requirement or story
âœ… Cover Edge                                 Cases	Think beyond normal use
âœ… Maintainable	                              Easy to update when feature changes
âœ… Unique	                                    No duplicate steps or cases

âœ… 3. Types of Test Cases
Type	                                                Purpose
ðŸ”¹ Positive	                                  Confirms feature works as expected
ðŸ”¹ Negative	                                  Confirms app handles invalid input properly
ðŸ”¹ Edge                                      Cases	Tests boundary values or limits
ðŸ”¹ UI Test                                   Cases	Focus on layout, labels, elements
ðŸ”¹ Integration	                             Interaction between modules (ex: Login + OTP)
ðŸ”¹ Regression	                               To ensure new changes didnâ€™t break old features
ðŸ”¹ Exploratory	                             Freestyle, without predefined steps

âœ… 4. Test Case Design Techniques (Black Box Based)
These are methods to help design efficient and high coverage test cases:

Technique	                               Description	                                         Example
1. Equivalence Partitioning	        Divide input into valid and invalid groups	      Age field: Valid = 18â€“60, Invalid = <18 or >60
2. Boundary Value Analysis	        Test edges of input ranges	                      Test 17, 18, 60, 61
3. Decision Table Testing	          Use tables for combinations of conditions	        Login: Blank email, blank pwd, both filled, etc.
4. State Transition Testing	        Focus on state changes	                          ATM: Card Inserted â†’ PIN Entered â†’ Balance Shown
5. Error Guessing	                  Based on experience/common mistakes	              Leaving email field blank or using wrong format
6. Use Case Testing	                End-to-end scenarios based on real user flows	    E-commerce checkout

âœ… 5. Test Case Format â€“ Template You Can Use
Field	                                 Description
Test Case ID	                      Unique ID (e.g., TC_Login_001)
Title	                              What is being tested (e.g., Valid Login)
Preconditions	                      What must exist before testing (e.g., User is registered)
Test Steps	                        Step-by-step instructions
Test Data	                          Inputs (e.g., email, password)
Expected Result	                    What should happen
Actual Result	                      Filled during execution
Status	                            Pass/Fail
Remarks	                            Notes or defects
