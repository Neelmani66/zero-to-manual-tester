# Zero to Manual Tester 🚀

Hi! I'm Neelmani Shukla, and this repository is a complete documentation of my journey to become a **Manual QA Tester** from scratch — aiming to be job-ready by **August–November 2025**.

I built this repo not only to learn deeply but also to show **employers, mentors, and peers** how I think, learn, and solve problems.

## 📍 Goal

To become a **skilled and job-ready Manual Tester** with:

- Strong understanding of software testing foundations.
- Hands-on experience with test case design, bug reporting, and QA tools.
- Knowledge of Agile/Scrum practices.
- Real-world testing examples.
- A GitHub portfolio to demonstrate my skills.
