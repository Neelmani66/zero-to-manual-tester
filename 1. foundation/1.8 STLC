🧩 Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)
The Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a structured process that testers follow to ensure the quality of software throughout its development.
While SDLC is the overall development lifecycle, STLC is tester-focused, describing all stages of testing from planning to closure.

🌀 STLC Phases Overview
There are 6 core phases in the STLC:

Phase No.	            Phase Name	                                Purpose
1️⃣	                Requirement Analysis	                 Understand “what” to test
2️⃣	                Test Planning	                         Decide “how” to test
3️⃣	                Test Case Design	                     Prepare test cases & test data
4️⃣	                Test Environment Setup	               Prepare testing infrastructure
5️⃣	                Test Execution	                       Run test cases and log bugs
6️⃣	                Test Closure	                         Final reporting and evaluation

🔍 1. Requirement Analysis
🎯 Objective:
Understand what features and functionalities need to be tested.

✅ Activities:
Read Business Requirement Documents (BRD), Functional Requirements (FRS), and Use Cases.
Clarify doubts with the BA or Product Owner.
Identify testable and non-testable requirements.
Perform feasibility analysis.

📌 Entry Criteria:
BRD/FRS is available.
Access to stakeholders for clarifications.

📦 Deliverables:
Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)
Automation feasibility report (if applicable)
**
📋 2. Test Planning
🎯 Objective:
Define the scope, strategy, resources, schedule, and objectives of testing.

✅ Activities:
Estimate effort, time, and cost.
Define test strategy (manual vs automation).
Assign roles and responsibilities.
Define tools to be used (e.g., bug trackers, test case tools).

📌 Entry Criteria:
Requirements are analyzed and confirmed.

📦 Deliverables:
Test Plan Document
Risk analysis
Resource plan
**
🛠️ 3. Test Case Design (Test Design / Test Development)
🎯 Objective:
Write detailed test cases that will validate the application.

✅ Activities:
Write test cases and test scenarios.
Identify test data and prepare it.
Review and get test cases approved.
Ensure traceability to requirements.

📌 Entry Criteria:
Approved Test Plan
Finalized RTM

📦 Deliverables:
Test Cases
Test Data
Updated RTM
**
🌐 4. Test Environment Setup
🎯 Objective:
Prepare the infrastructure where testing will be executed.

✅ Activities:
Set up software/hardware/network environment.
Install test tools, databases, application builds.
Ensure correct test data is loaded.
Perform smoke testing.

📌 Entry Criteria:
Application build is available
Test plan & test cases are ready

📦 Deliverables:
Test Environment configured
Smoke Test Results
**
▶️ 5. Test Execution
🎯 Objective:
Run the test cases and log bugs if any are found.

✅ Activities:
Execute test cases (manually or via automation).
Mark test cases as Pass/Fail/Blocked
Log defects in a bug tracking tool (e.g., Jira).

Retest and perform regression testing.

📌 Entry Criteria:
Test Environment is ready

Approved test cases & test data available

📦 Deliverables:
Test Execution Reports
Defect Reports
Updated RTM
**
📊 6. Test Closure
🎯 Objective:
Wrap up testing activities and analyze the outcome.

✅ Activities:
Final reporting: metrics like bug count, severity, coverage.
Prepare Test Summary Report.
Lessons learned and best practices.
Close defect tickets and test environment.

📌 Entry Criteria:
All test cases executed
All critical defects fixed and verified

📦 Deliverables:
Test Summary Report
Metrics Report
Lessons Learned Document

🧠 Why STLC Is Important for a Manual Tester?
Helps you work in a structured and organized manner.
Gives visibility into where you are in the testing process.
Reduces the risk of missing test scenarios.
Essential for process maturity and working in teams.
