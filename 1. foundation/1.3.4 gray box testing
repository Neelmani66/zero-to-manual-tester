1. ‚úÖ What is Gray Box Testing?

Gray Box Testing is a hybrid approach that combines aspects of Black Box (external functionality) and White Box (internal code-level knowledge) testing.
The tester has limited knowledge of the internal workings of the system.
It‚Äôs like being a user with some developer insight (e.g., knowing database schema, architecture, or data flow).
Common in integration testing, API testing, security testing, or when testers get access to internal documentation.

2. üîç Why is Gray Box Testing Useful?

Balances coverage and perspective: You get the external view of a user and internal awareness like a developer.
Helps catch issues that black-box testing might miss, such as:
Incorrect data flow
Broken API integration
Security holes
Encourages better collaboration between devs and testers.

3. üéØ Who Performs It?

Manual Testers with internal access
QA Engineers with partial system access
Security/Test Analysts doing API or integration validation

4. üß© Where Is Gray Box Testing Used?

Integration Testing between modules/systems
Web Services & API Testing (with access to API contract/schema)
Database Testing (understanding table structure, not full code)
Security Testing
Regression Testing with understanding of change impact

5. ‚öôÔ∏è Techniques Used in Gray Box Testing

Technique                                	Description

Matrix Testing	                Verifies the relationship between modules, data, and responsibilities.
Regression Testing            	With internal knowledge of recent code changes.
Pattern Testing	                Testing design patterns, common coding practices, or flow structures.
Database Testing	              Validating data at backend (inserts, triggers, joins) with knowledge of schema.
API Testing	                    Using tools like Postman or Swagger with access to request/response schema.
