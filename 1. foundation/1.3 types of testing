üîπ Categorizing Testing Types
We'll organize 20+ critical types into 4 smart groups:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Based on Access to Code (Box Testing)
Type	                                 Description	                                                                  
Black Box	                         Tester knows only inputs and expected outputs. Doesn't see code.	
White Box                        	 Tester sees the internal logic, code structure, loops, conditions.
Grey Box	                         Tester has partial code or system knowledge.	

2Ô∏è‚É£ Based on Testing Method (Execution Approach)
Type	                                Description	
Manual	                          Test cases are executed manually.	
Automation	                      Scripts are used to run tests automatically.

‚ùó Manual testing is great for usability, exploratory.
Automation is ideal for regression, large test suites.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Based on Testing Level (SDLC Phase)
These follow the development lifecycle:

Level                            	Goal	                              Who Does It
Unit	                  Test smallest parts of code.	             Developers (white box)
Integration	            Test interactions between modules.	       Developers / Testers
System	                Test entire system end-to-end.	           QA/Testers
Acceptance	            Validate if system meets business needs.	 Client / Business team / QA

üìå Example:

Unit: test login() function.

Integration: login() + database interaction.

System: Full login to dashboard flow.

Acceptance: Client says ‚ÄúI want only verified users to log in.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Based on Purpose (Why We Test)

‚úÖ Functional Testing (What app should do)

Type	                             Description                         	Example

Smoke	                    Basic build verification	               Check if homepage, login work
Sanity	                  Narrow check of a recent fix	           Test only cart page after bug fix
Regression	              Make sure old features still work	       Re-run all login, search tests
Retesting	                Re-run failed test after fix	           Same test case that failed
Ad-hoc	                  Unplanned creative testing	             Random inputs, edge cases
Exploratory             	Learn the app while testing	             Try all buttons/features
Usability	                Is the UI friendly?	                     Navigation, buttons, clarity

üõ†Ô∏è Non-Functional Testing (How app behaves)

Type	                            Description                          	Example
Performance	             Speed, response time (Load, Stress)	     App slows after 1000 users
Security	               Sensitive data protected?	               Can someone access user profile by changing URL?
Compatibility            Works on all browsers/devices	           Chrome, Firefox, Android, iPhone
Localization	           UI/UX works in local language	           Translations, date format
Recovery	               App recovers from crash/errors	           App handles power cut gracefully
