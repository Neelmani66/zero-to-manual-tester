âœ… What is SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)?
The Software Development Life Cycle is the overall process of developing software â€” from the initial idea to final deployment and maintenance.

Think of it as the developerâ€™s roadmap.

ðŸ§± Phases of SDLC:
1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis
Stakeholders, Product Owners gather business needs.
Testers may get involved early to review requirements.

2. System Design
Architects/designers plan the software architecture.
Testers understand design to plan edge cases.

3. Implementation (Coding)
Developers start writing code.
Testers begin preparing test cases, test data.

4. Testing
Testers execute manual/automated tests.
Report bugs, validate fixes.

5. Deployment
Code is released to production.

6. Maintenance
Fix production issues, handle updates.

ðŸ§ª What is STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)?
The Software Testing Life Cycle is the step-by-step process followed by testers to ensure the quality of the software.

Think of it as the testerâ€™s roadmap inside the larger SDLC.

ðŸ§± Phases of STLC:
1. Requirement Analysis
Review functional and non-functional requirements.
Identify what needs to be tested.

2. Test Planning
Decide strategy, effort, tools, roles.
Create Test Plan document.

3. Test Case Design
Write detailed test cases and scenarios.
Use techniques like BVA, EP, etc.

4. Test Environment Setup
Ensure environment, tools, data are ready for execution.

5. Test Execution
Execute test cases manually or with tools.
Log defects.

6. Test Closure
Create final test reports.
Assess what went well, what didnâ€™t.
