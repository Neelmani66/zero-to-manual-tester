Testing techniques help testers design effective test cases.
These can be broadly categorized into:

üß† I. Black Box Techniques
(Focus: Behavior of the system, not the code)

Technique                                    	What It Does	                                                                                 Common Use Case
Equivalence Partitioning (EP)     	Divides input data into valid/invalid groups (partitions) and tests one value from each.	       Login forms, numeric input fields.
Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)     	Focuses on testing the edges (min/max) of input fields.	                                         Age, limits, price fields.
Decision Table Testing	            Tests combinations of inputs and business rules.                            	                   Loan approval, discount logic, etc.
State Transition Testing	          Tests how software behaves when moving from one state to another.	                               Login lockout, ATM flow.
Error Guessing	                    Based on tester‚Äôs experience ‚Äî guess common failures and test them.	                             Login, uploads, invalid formats, etc.

‚öôÔ∏è II. White Box Techniques
(Focus: Internal logic/code structure ‚Äî usually by developers)

Technique	                                   Description
Statement Coverage	                Every line of code should be executed at least once.
Decision/Branch Coverage	          Every possible true/false decision outcome is tested.
Condition Coverage	                All boolean conditions in a decision are tested independently.

ü©∂ III. Gray Box Techniques
(Focus: Combination ‚Äî tester knows some internals)

Matrix-based testing
Database testing
Session/state testing
Used when testers know some business logic, database structure, or internal workflow.

üõ†Ô∏è Choosing the Right Technique

Project Type	                             Technique to Prioritize
Form-based (Login, Register)	      EP, BVA, Error Guessing
Workflow/State-dependent	          State Transition, Decision Table
Business Rule-heavy	                Decision Table
Critical Calculations	              BVA, EP
API/Backend/Rules with Logic	      Statement & Branch Coverage (by Devs)
