1. What is Non-Functional Testing?
Non-Functional Testing (NFT) verifies how well the software performs under various conditions. 
Instead of checking “does the software do what it should” (functional), it checks how it does it.

It covers aspects like:

Performance
Usability
Reliability
Security
Scalability

Think of it as the “quality attributes” of the system.

2. Why is Non-Functional Testing Important?

User Experience: Ensures the software is fast, responsive, and user-friendly.
Reliability: Verifies the system can run continuously without failures.
Security: Protects data and prevents vulnerabilities.
Scalability: Confirms the software can handle growing users or data.
Compliance: Meets industry standards and regulations.

Failing NFT can cause user dissatisfaction, data breaches, crashes, or downtime — all costly issues.

3. When & Where is Non-Functional Testing Done?

Usually after functional testing and before release.
During System Testing or Acceptance Testing phases.
Can also be continuous in DevOps and CI/CD pipelines for performance monitoring.

4. Types of Non-Functional Testing
Here are the major types, what they mean, and why they matter:

Type	                                Description	                                            Why Important?

Performance Testing	          Checks speed, responsiveness, and stability under load	       To ensure fast and stable user experience
Load Testing	                Tests software under expected user loads	                     To verify handling of normal usage
Stress Testing	              Pushes software beyond normal limits to find breaking points	 To understand limits and failure points
Scalability Testing	          Tests ability to scale up or down with user base	             To ensure growth won’t break software
Security Testing	            Identifies vulnerabilities and weaknesses	                     To protect data and prevent attacks
Usability Testing           	Evaluates user-friendliness and interface design	             To ensure easy and intuitive use
Compatibility Testing	        Checks software on different devices, browsers, OS	           To ensure broad user accessibility
Reliability Testing	          Ensures software runs without failure over time	               To guarantee uptime and stability
Maintainability Testing	      Checks how easy it is to maintain and update software	         To reduce future costs and downtime
Compliance Testing	          Validates adherence to standards and regulations	             To avoid legal and regulatory issues

5. How to Perform Non-Functional Testing?
Step 1: Identify Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
Understand what qualities the software must have — often documented in SRS or NFR documents.

Step 2: Plan Test Scenarios
Create test scenarios to validate each non-functional attribute, e.g., “Check page loads under 2 seconds with 1000 users.”

Step 3: Select Tools
Pick appropriate tools based on the test type (more below).

Step 4: Execute Tests
Run tests in controlled environments simulating real-world conditions.

Step 5: Analyze Results
Compare metrics against benchmarks. Investigate failures or bottlenecks.

Step 6: Report & Retest
Log issues, fix, and retest to validate improvements.

6. Common Tools for Non-Functional Testing

Test Type	                          Popular Tools                        	Manual/Automation
Performance/Load/Stress	       JMeter, LoadRunner, Gatling                   Automation
Security	                     OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Nessus	          Manual & Automation
Usability	                     UserTesting.com, Lookback                    Mostly Manual
Compatibility	                 BrowserStack, Sauce Labs	                Automation/Manual Hybrid
Reliability/Maintainability	   Custom monitoring & logging tools	        Mostly Automation
