1. ‚úÖ What is White Box Testing?

White Box Testing (also known as Clear Box, Glass Box, or Structural Testing) is a testing technique where the internal code structure, logic, and design of the software is known and tested.
You test how the system works internally.
Focuses on code coverage, logic flow, conditions, paths, loops.
Usually performed by developers.

üéØ Manual testers need to understand what it is, how it complements black-box testing, and how to read or reference unit tests or coverage reports.

2. üß© Why is White Box Testing Important?

Verifies the internal logic is correct.
Ensures all code paths are executed/tested.
Detects hidden bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks.
Increases code quality, especially when automated.

3. üïµÔ∏è Who Performs It?

Primarily Developers.
Automation Engineers may also write white-box style test scripts.
QA may review test coverage to ensure complete testing, especially in Agile teams.

4. üß™ Types of White Box Testing

Type	                           What it Does

Unit Testing	             Tests individual units/functions in isolation.
Integration Testing	       Tests interaction between modules or classes (internally).
Code Coverage Testing	     Measures how much of the source code is tested (100% not always necessary, but higher is better).
Path Testing	             Ensures every possible path in the code is tested.
Loop Testing	             Tests loops (for, while, do-while) to verify correct execution and boundaries.
Condition/Branch Testing   Validates each decision point (if/else, switch) executes correctly.


5. ‚öôÔ∏è Techniques Used in White Box Testing

Technique	                           Description

Statement Coverage	            Has every statement in the code been executed?
Branch Coverage     	          Have all branches (if/else) been tested?
Path Coverage	                  Have all possible logical paths been tested?
Condition Coverage	            Have all Boolean conditions been tested as true and false?
Multiple Condition Coverage	    Have combinations of conditions been tested?


6. üß∞ Common White Box Testing Tools

Tool	                            Used For

JUnit / NUnit / TestNG	     Unit Testing (Java, .NET)
PyTest                     	 Python unit testing
JaCoCo / Cobertura	         Code Coverage tools for Java
SonarQube	                   Static analysis + code quality insights
CppUnit	                     Unit testing in C++
Google Test	                 C/C++ unit testing
Postman with pre-scripts	   API-level white-box checks


üßë‚Äçüíª You don‚Äôt need to master these as a manual tester, but knowing them helps you collaborate with developers.
