🧠 Definition
Software Testing is the process of evaluating a software application to identify whether it meets the specified requirements and to ensure that it is free of defects.
It verifies that the application behaves as expected, functions properly under various conditions, and delivers quality to the end-user.

👇 Simple View:
Testing is checking if the software works correctly and safely before it reaches the user.

🎯 Goals of Software Testing
Goal                                          	What it Means
✅ Verification                         	Does the software meet the requirements?
🐞 Bug Detection	                        Are there any unexpected behaviors or issues?
🔒 Reliability & Security	                Is the system safe, stable, and secure?
🚀 Performance                           Check	Does the app handle load, stress, and data volume well?
👤 User Satisfaction	                    Will the end-user experience be smooth and intuitive?

🔍 Why Software Testing is Important
Without testing, software could lead to:

❌ System crashes (e.g., a banking app crashing during transactions)
🧱 Loss of data or money (e.g., billing miscalculations)
⚠️ Security issues (e.g., passwords being exposed)
😡 User dissatisfaction (leading to lost business)
💸 Costly post-release fixes (10x more expensive after release)

🧾 Real Example:
In 2018, British Airways lost customer data due to a bug in their payment system – a result of poor testing. The company was fined £183 million.

🔁 When Testing Happens: The Basic Workflow

1. Requirements are gathered.
2. Developers write code based on requirements.
3. Testers verify if the software meets those requirements.
4. Bugs are reported and fixed.
5. The cycle repeats until the product is stable.


🔍 Difference Between Error, Defect, Bug & Failure

Term	                           Meaning
Error                     	A human mistake in the code (by developer or tester)
Defect                      The result of an error in the application
Bug	                        Informal term for a defect, used during testing
Failure	                    When the software doesn’t perform its intended function in real-time

🧠 Example: A developer forgets a condition → that’s an error.
When the software crashes because of it → it’s a failure.

👷 Who Does the Testing?
1. Manual Testers / QA Engineers
2. Developers (Unit Testing)
3. Product Owners (Acceptance Testing)
4. End-users (Beta Testing)
